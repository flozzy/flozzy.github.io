        SCHEDULE IT
      </h2>
    <p>This is something I designed myself.  I developed high-fidelity wireframes, 
      clickable prototypes, and user flows for the mobile application. It is a scheduling application design. 
      th time at hand and the pandemic we are in, it will help save time.
      It allows the user to schedule hospital appointments with any hospital/ Clinic near them without 
      having to go physically to the hospital and wait. This will have the patient with time management and 
      help reduce crowd in the hospital/clinic.
